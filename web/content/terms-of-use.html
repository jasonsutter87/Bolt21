          <p><span class="SubHead">Agreement to Terms</span></p>

          <p>By downloading, installing, or using Bolt21 ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.</p>

          <p><span class="SubHead">Nature of the Service</span></p>

          <p>Bolt21 is a self-custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet. This means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You control your funds.</strong> Only you have access to your private keys and seed phrase.</li>
            <li><strong>You are responsible for security.</strong> If you lose your seed phrase, you lose access to your funds permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>We cannot recover your funds.</strong> We have no ability to access, freeze, or recover your Bitcoin.</li>
            <li><strong>We do not custody your assets.</strong> Bolt21 is software, not a financial institution.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="SubHead">Assumption of Risk</span></p>

            <li>Cryptocurrency values are volatile and you may lose value</li>
            <li>The Lightning Network is experimental technology</li>
            <li>Software bugs may exist despite our best efforts</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for securing your device and seed phrase</li>
          </ul>
