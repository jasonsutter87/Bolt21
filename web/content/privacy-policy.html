          <p><span class="SubHead">Our Commitment to Privacy</span></p>

          <p>Bolt21 is a self-custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet. We are committed to protecting your privacy and believe that financial sovereignty includes data sovereignty. This policy explains what information we collect (spoiler: almost nothing) and how we handle it.</p>

          <p><span class="SubHead">Self-Custodial Means Self-Sovereign</span></p>

          <p>Bolt21 is designed with privacy as a core principle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your keys stay on your device.</strong> We never have access to your private keys or seed phrase.</li>
            <li><strong>No account required.</strong> You don't need to provide an email, phone number, or any personal information to use Bolt21.</li>
            <li><strong>No KYC.</strong> We don't collect identity documents or perform identity verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Local-first.</strong> Your wallet data is stored locally on your device.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="SubHead">What We Don't Collect</span></p>

          <p>Unlike traditional financial apps, Bolt21 does NOT collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your name, email, or phone number</li>
            <li>Your location or IP address</li>
            <li>Your transaction history</li>
            <li>Your Bitcoin balance</li>
            <li>Your contacts or address book</li>
            <li>Analytics or usage tracking data</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="SubHead">Lightning Network Considerations</span></p>

          <p>Bolt21 uses the Breez SDK to connect to the Lightning Network. When you make Lightning payments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Payment routing information is processed by Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) to facilitate payments</li>
            <li>This is inherent to how the Lightning Network operates</li>
            <li>We recommend reviewing Breez's privacy policy for details on their data handling</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="SubHead">BOLT12 and Ocean Mining</span></p>

          <p>When using BOLT12 offers for Ocean mining payouts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your BOLT12 offer is shared with Ocean to enable payouts</li>
            <li>Ocean's privacy policy governs how they handle this information</li>
            <li>Bolt21 does not intermediate or store this data</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="SubHead">Open Source Transparency</span></p>

          <p>Bolt21 is open source software. You can audit our code to verify our privacy claims:</p>
