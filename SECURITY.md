## Security Measures

Bolt21 implements the following security measures:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Biometric-only authentication** - No PIN/pattern fallback (prevents shoulder surfing)
- **Payment re-authentication** - Large payments (>100k sats) require biometric confirmation
- **Secure storage** - Keys stored in iOS Keychain / Android Keystore

### Data Protection
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** - All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Secure clipboard** - Auto-clears after 30 seconds with race condition protection
- **Log sanitization** - Mnemonics, keys, and addresses are redacted from logs
- **Screen recording protection** - Content hidden during screen capture

### Network Security
- **Certificate pinning** - TrustKit (iOS) and network_security_config (Android)
- **TLS 1.2+ required** - No insecure connections allowed
- **Forward secrecy** - All connections use forward-secret cipher suites

### Supply Chain Security
- **Pinned dependencies** - Git dependencies pinned to specific commits
- **No bundled secrets** - API keys provided via dart-define at build time

### Crash Recovery
- **Operation state persistence** - Payment state survives app crashes
- **Atomic transactions** - Mutex locks prevent double-spend
- **Idempotent payments** - Duplicate payment prevention
